== Description ==
CareerSitesPro’s plugin provides a simple way to visualize your open positions on your website.

The plugin was carefully designed to provide you a very simple layout that helps drive people to apply to your open positions. This extension also connects with over 15 hiring/recruiting tools.

The settings area allows you to configure your career site. Some of the features include:

- Map orientation of your current open positions
- Customizable search bar
- Customize the colors to match your site
- Social media hyperlinks
- Many more

To set up the plugin, simply provide your API key from your hiring system, and add the CareerSitesPro’s short code to the page you want your job listings on.

Our plugin relies on 3rd access to https://feeds.applicantpro.com to pull in data for current open positions.  This requires the use of a token provided by your Applicant Tracking System.
